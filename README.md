## Setting up the environment

The language used for the praticals is Python. You can either download a pre-packaged
distribution with scientific computing packages sur as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
or use a standard Python install and install the dependencies listed in
`requirements.txt`.

To use `virtualenv` and `pip`, you can type:

```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Enter the virtualenv with `source venv/bin/activate` and leave it with `deactivate`
